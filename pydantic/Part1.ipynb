In these lessons, we explore the sources of return for fixed-income investments and demonstrate investment returns in different scenarios, including the one embedded in the YTM calculations. Prior lessons also established interest rate risk. We show how investment horizon, in relation to a bond’s features, is a key determinant of interest rate risk for investors and how different investors in the same fixed-income invest- ment can have different returns and views on risk.\",\n",
