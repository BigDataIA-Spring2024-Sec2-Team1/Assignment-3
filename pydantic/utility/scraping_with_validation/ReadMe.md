## Setup and Running Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Chrome browser installed.
- Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome version. You can download it from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and ensure it's in your system PATH.

### Installation
1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required Python packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Script
1. Open the terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory if you're not already there.

3. Run the script.

```bash
python script.py
```

4. The script will start scraping data from the CFA Institute website and save the results to a CSV file named `refresher_readings.csv` in the project directory.

### Note
- Depending on your system configuration, you may need to adjust the Chrome WebDriver path in the `initialize_driver` function of the script (`script.py`).
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection while running the script as it requires internet access to scrape data from the website.
